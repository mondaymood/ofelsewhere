description: "Ubud, nestled in the heart of Bali, quickly became one of my favorite destinations. My visits in May and November 2022 revealed a perfect blend of bustling energy and serene hideaways. Despite its popularity with tourists, Ubud retains its charm with hidden calm spots and a captivating atmosphere. Surrounded by lush jungles and tranquil rice fields, it’s a haven for yoga enthusiasts and food lovers alike, boasting delicious, healthy cuisine and beautifully designed cafés. Ubud's unique allure left a lasting impression, making it an essential stop on any Bali itinerary."

    headline: What to see
    description: "From the charming wooden houses of Gion and Higashiyama to iconic landmarks like Fushimi Inari-Taisha and the Arashiyama Bamboo Forest, there is definitely a lot to see in Kyoto. I highly recommend spending a few days immersing yourself in this magical city, ideally starting your visits early in the day to avoid the crowds that flock to these popular attractions (it will most likely be crowded nevertheless, so be prepared). For a peaceful break away from the hustle and bustle, consider exploring the Garden of Fine Arts and the Botanical Garden which you can combine with a relaxed stroll along the Kamo river."

        description: "The Sweet Orange Walk through the Kajeng Rice Field is a hidden gem in Ubud, offering a peaceful escape from the bustling town center. This scenic trail winds through serene rice fields, providing stunning views and a tranquil atmosphere. It's especially enchanting at sunset, with the golden light casting a magical glow over the landscape. Despite its beauty, it remains relatively undiscovered, allowing for a quiet, meditative stroll with few tourists around. This hidden path quickly became my favorite spot in Ubud, perfect for soaking in the natural beauty and tranquility of Bali."

        description: "Fushimi Inari Taisha, situated in southern Kyoto, is a sacred Shinto shrine that should not be missed. Famous for its thousands of vermilion torii gates winding through a forested pathway, it offers a breathtaking glimpse into Japan's spiritual traditions. Due to its popularity, I recommend hiking all the way to the top, as most visitors tend to linger closer to the bottom. While it is a bit of a workout, the rewarding views and serene atmosphere are definitely worth it."

This open-air museum features modern architecture and  reproductions of renowned masterpieces against the backdrop of a calming waterfall. My favorite piece was the Choju Giga — an ancient scroll depicting whimsical animal-person caricatures, often regarded as the very first manga."

While it wasn't my personal favorite stop (even though I arrived in the morning it was already quite busy and the forest was shorter than I thought) there's no denying the beauty of the bamboo grove. Next to the forest you can also explore Tenryū-ji, a stunning Zen temple, adding an extra layer of serenity to the experience."

When in doubt, you can always count on stumbling upon a sushi or ramen joint that will leave you fully satisfied.

        description: "Undoubtedly, Nishiki Market should be the first stop on your culinary journey through Kyoto. This vibrant market offers an array of stalls, where you'll find everything from fresh seafood to local delicacies. My standout experience was at Kimura Fresh Fish, where I had the most exquisite sake sashimi I've ever tasted – I'm still not over it. And before you leave, be sure to indulge in a Taiyaki, a delightful fish-shaped cake filled with either custard or red bean paste. So good!"

Not only was this restaurant tastefully designed with cute lemon illustrations adorning signs and menus, but the food was also absolutely delicious. I indulged in Yuzu ramen and dumplings that resembled little lemons—couldn't ask for more."
