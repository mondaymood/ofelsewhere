description: "It didn't take long before Kyoto earned its place as one of my favorite destinations worldwide. While planning and researching my trip to Japan, I was most excited about exploring this part of the country, and it did not disappoint. The city's seamless blend of tradition and modernity creates a unique atmosphere that instantly captivates. You can feel the attention to detail everywhere you look, from the ancient temples to the beautifully designed cafes.
<br><br>
I especially remember the peacefulness of wandering the charming streets early in the morning or while stepping away from the crowds in search of the next cute coffee shop. This historic city is an essential stop on any trip to Japan – I could have easily stayed for weeks and hope to return for a longer stay one day."

    headline: What to see
    description: "From the charming wooden houses of Gion and Higashiyama to iconic landmarks like Fushimi Inari-Taisha and the Arashiyama Bamboo Forest, there is definitely a lot to see in Kyoto. I highly recommend spending a few days immersing yourself in this magical city, ideally starting your visits early in the day to avoid the crowds that flock to these popular attractions (it will most likely be crowded nevertheless, so be prepared). For a peaceful break away from the hustle and bustle, consider exploring the Garden of Fine Arts and the Botanical Garden which you can combine with a relaxed stroll along the Kamo river."

I especially enjoyed watching the other visitors dressed in elegant kimonos. But the highlight was spotting a beautiful Maiko, who kindly posed for a photo, making my visit to the neighborhood even more memorable."

With a bit of patience, I was able to capture the iconic shot of the pagoda framed against the morning sky. No guarantees though."

Famous for its thousands of vermilion torii gates winding through a forested pathway, it offers a breathtaking glimpse into Japan's spiritual traditions. Due to its popularity, I recommend hiking all the way to the top, as most visitors tend to linger closer to the bottom. While it is a bit of a workout, the rewarding views and serene atmosphere are definitely worth it."

This open-air museum features modern architecture and  reproductions of renowned masterpieces against the backdrop of a calming waterfall. My favorite piece was the Choju Giga — an ancient scroll depicting whimsical animal-person caricatures, often regarded as the very first manga."

While it wasn't my personal favorite stop (even though I arrived in the morning it was already quite busy and the forest was shorter than I thought) there's no denying the beauty of the bamboo grove. Next to the forest you can also explore Tenryū-ji, a stunning Zen temple, adding an extra layer of serenity to the experience."

This vibrant market offers an array of stalls, where you'll find everything from fresh seafood to local delicacies. My standout experience was at Kimura Fresh Fish, where I had the most exquisite sake sashimi I've ever tasted – I'm still not over it. And before you leave, be sure to indulge in a Taiyaki, a delightful fish-shaped cake filled with either custard or red bean paste. So good!"

Not only was this restaurant tastefully designed with cute lemon illustrations adorning signs and menus, but the food was also absolutely delicious. I indulged in Yuzu ramen and dumplings that resembled little lemons—couldn't ask for more."
